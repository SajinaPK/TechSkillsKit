# Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the **best option available at the moment**. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result.

The algorithm **never reverses the earlier decision** even if the choice is wrong. It works in a top-down approach.

This algorithm may not produce the best result for all the problems. It's because it always goes for the local best choice to produce the global best result.

**Drawback of Greedy Approach** - It doesn't always produce the optimal solution.
