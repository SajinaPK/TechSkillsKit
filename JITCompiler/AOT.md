# AOT


Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation allows the compilation of Javaâ„¢ classes into native code for subsequent executions of the same program. The AOT compiler works with the class data sharing framework.

The AOT compiler generates native code dynamically while an application runs and caches any generated AOT code in the shared data cache. Subsequent JVMs that execute the method can load and use the AOT code from the shared data cache without incurring the performance decrease experienced with JIT-compiled native code.

The AOT compiler is enabled by default, but is only active when shared classes are enabled. By default, shared classes are disabled so that no AOT activity occurs. When the AOT compiler is active, the compiler selects the methods to be AOT compiled with the primary goal of improving startup time.

Note: Because AOT code must persist over different program executions, AOT-generated code does not perform as well as JIT-generated code. AOT code usually performs better than interpreted code.


**Class data sharing**

When loading a class, the JVM internally stores the class in two key parts:
* 		The immutable (read only) portion of the class.
* 		The mutable (writeable) portion of the class.

When enabled, shared classes shares the immutable parts of a class between JVMs, which has the following benefits:
* 		The amount of physical memory used can be significantly less when using more than one JVM instance.
* 		Loading classes from a populated cache is faster than loading classes from disk, because classes are already partially verified and are possibly already loaded in memory. Therefore, class sharing also benefits applications that regularly start new JVM instances doing similar tasks.
Caching AOT methods reduces the affect of JIT compilation when the same classes are loaded by multiple JVMs. In addition, because a shared classes cache might persist beyond the life of a JVM, subsequent JVMs that run can benefit from AOT methods already stored in the cache.
