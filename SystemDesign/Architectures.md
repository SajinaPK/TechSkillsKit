1. **GraphQL Architecture Pattern**

   GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by providing a complete and understandable description of the data in your API. It allows clients to request only the data they need and nothing more.
   
   Key Components are:
   
     Schema: The core of GraphQL's type system, defining types and relationships between them. It specifies the capabilities of an API by defining the types of queries and mutations that can be made and the shape of the responses.
   
     Queries: Operations that clients use to request data. Clients specify the exact data they need, and the server responds with precisely that data, eliminating over-fetching or under-fetching.
   
     Mutation: Operations that clients use to modify server-side data. They can create, update, or delete data and specify the return data structure.
   
     Resolvers: Functions that resolve the values of GraphQL queries and mutations. They map the schema fields to underlying data sources and logic.
   
   Use cases:
   
     Ideal for applications where data is highly interconnected, like social networks or e-commerce platforms.
   
     Mobile and single page applications, these applications benefit from fetching only the necessary data in a single request, reducing the number of network calls and improving performance.
   
     Applications that require real-time updates, such as collaborative tools and live data feeds, can leverage GraphQL subscriptions.

3. **RESTful Architecture**
   RESTful architecture is a way to design networked applications. It stands for Representational State Transfer (REST). RESTful web services use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, which are identified by URLs.
   
   Key Components are:
   
     Resource: These are the key abstractions in REST, representing any kind of entity or data that can be accessed and manipulated. For example, users, books, and orders can all be considered resources.
   
     URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers): Each resource is identified by a unique URI. For example, http://example.com/users/123 might identify a specific user.
   
     HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
   
     Resources are represented in a format such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients interact with these representations and perform actions on the actual resource through the representations.
   
   Use cases:
   
     Web APIs for web and mobile applications.
   
     Services that require stateless interactions like weather APIs, news APIs, microservices, search engines, social media feeds, CDN, geolocation services.
   
     Public APIs that need to support a wide range of clients.
